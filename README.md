# YuviTal Life SDK - iOS (Objective-C) Sample Integration Guide

This repository contains an **iOS Objective-C sample application** that demonstrates how to integrate the YuviTal Life SDK into a native iOS app.

---

## Compatibility Notice

This SDK is designed exclusively for **native mobile applications** developed using:

-   **iOS:** Objective-C or Swift

### Prerequisites

-   **Target OS:** iOS 15.5+

**Add Cloudsmith CocoaPods token to .netrc**

```swift
sed -i.bak "/^machine dl\.cloudsmith\.io/d" ~/.netrc 2>/dev/null || touch ~/.netrc
echo "\nmachine dl.cloudsmith.io login token password <CLOUDSMITH_TOKEN>" >> ~/.netrc
```

After updating `~/.netrc`, make sure its permissions are restricted:
```ruby
chmod 600 ~/.netrc
```
This is required so tools like CocoaPods will use the credentials in `.netrc`.

**Add to Podfile**

If your project doesn’t have a `Podfile` yet, create one in your Xcode project directory (make sure CocoaPods is already installed):
```ruby
cd <PATH_TO_YOUR_XCODE_PROJECT>
pod init
```

Add this to your `Podfile`:
```ruby
source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'
source "https://dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/yuvital/yuvital-life-sdk-production/cocoapods/index.git"

target '<YOUR_TARGET>' do
    use_frameworks!

    pod 'YuvitalLifeSDK', '1.1.6'
end
```

Ensure your app’s **iOS Deployment Target** is set to **iOS 15.5 or later**:

- In Xcode, select your app target.
- Go to the **General** tab.
- Under **Minimum Deployments**, set **iOS 15.5** (or higher) as the Deployment Target.

Install the dependencies:
```ruby
pod install
```

After running `pod install`, **always open the generated `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode** (not the `.xcodeproj`).  
If you see build errors about missing pods or modules, make sure you opened the `.xcworkspace`.

**HealthKit Setup & Info.plist Configuration**

Add these keys to Info.plist

```swift
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>We want access to your health data so we can help you track your achievements and reach your goals</string>
<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
<string>We want access to your health data so we can help you track your achievements and reach your goals</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses the camera to take photos for certain features.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses the photo gallery to use images for certain features.</string>
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<false/>
```

Enable HealthKit capability (Entitlements)

In **Signing & Capabilities** for your target, add **HealthKit**:

```swift
    <!-- In your .entitlements file -->
<key>com.apple.developer.healthkit</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.developer.healthkit.access</key>
<array>
    <string>health-records</string>
</array>
```

**User Script Sandboxing**

Xcode enables User Script Sandboxing by default, which can block CocoaPods’ standard [CP] Embed Pods Frameworks script from copying the SDK’s frameworks, causing Operation not permitted build errors. To allow the SDK to be embedded correctly, you need to disable this sandboxing for your app target.

- In Xcode, select your app target.
- Open the **Build Settings** tab.
- Search for **`ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING`**.
- Set **`ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING`** to **`NO`** for all configurations (Debug/Release).


**Open The SDK Screen**

The Yuvital Life SDK provides a React Native screen with the module name **`"YuvitalLifeNativeSdk"`**. Initialize the React runtime **once**, then present this screen wherever needed in your application.

Open the SDK from any screen

**Initialize once at startup** (AppDelegate, SceneDelegate or SwiftUI App)

```objc
import YuvitalLifeSDK
import ReactBrownfield

// AppDelegate example
func application(...) -> Bool {
    // ...
    ReactNativeBrownfield.shared.bundle = ReactNativeBundle
    ReactNativeBrownfield.shared.startReactNative()
    // ...
}
```

The SDK includes a ready‑made view controller YuvitalLifeSdkViewController that hosts the YuvitalLifeNativeSdk screen.
Push the wrapper that hosts the SDK from any screen:

```swift
import YuvitalLifeSDK
import ReactBrownfield

func openYuvitalLifeSdkTapped() {
    let rnVC = ReactNativeViewController(moduleName: "YuvitalLifeNativeSdk")
    let sdkWrapper = YuvitalLifeSdkViewController(embeddedViewController: rnVC)
    navigationController?.pushViewController(sdkWrapper, animated: true)
}
```
